Building a App using AI – Bell Curve Tabata / HIIT
Here is my experience to build a App using Open AI and Deepseek.

I wanted to create a HIIT workout timer that automatically generates a Tabata workout with variable times. I’m using a Bell Curve algorithm to determine the duration of each work and rest round. I’ve been brainstorming this idea for a while because I don’t enjoy static work and rest intervals in HIIT training.

The Bell Curve idea ensures that the workout starts slowly, builds up intensity, and then tapers down.

I wanted the inputs to be simple, duration and number of rounds.. Overthinking is the killer of motivation.

I put allot of thought into this design to support motivation;

Rest and Go Count Down time is different, so you don’t have to look at the timer.
Go and Rest announcement again so you don’t have to look at the timer.
Visual Count down, so you know how long to go.
Animated GIF exercises displayed randomly, some of the best free standing body weight exercises. No need for any gym equipment.
Allot more..
I was able to build this in just half a day this morning using https://chat.deepseek.com/.

I know enough JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to get by, but not enough to spend excessive time on this project myself.

For the audio, I used ElevenLabs, and I resized the GIFs using GIMP, sourcing some from the internet.

Here it is – http://www.detectx.com.au/apps/tabata/

I also converted this to a a progressive web app (PWA), is a website that functions like a native app. PWAs are built using web technologies and can run on multiple devices and platforms and using Bootstrap. So it behaves like a native iPhone App/icon.

Steps to Add the Website to Your iPhone Home Screen:
Open Safari:
Launch the Safari browser on your iPhone.
Go to the Website:
In the address bar, type or paste the URL: http://www.detectx.com.au/apps/tabata/.
Tap the Share Icon:
Once the website loads, tap the Share icon at the bottom of the screen (it looks like a square with an upward arrow).
Select “Add to Home Screen”:
Scroll down in the Share menu and select “Add to Home Screen”.
Customize the Name:
You can edit the name of the icon if you’d like (e.g., “Tabata Timer”).
Tap “Add” in the top-right corner.
Find the Icon on Your Home Screen:
The website icon will now appear on your home screen. You can tap it to open the website directly.
